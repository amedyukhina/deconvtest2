# Deconvtest2: framework to quantify and compare the performance of image restoration methods

This is an in-progress work on optimizing the [previous version](https://github.com/applied-systems-biology/DeconvTest) of the framework. The goal is to make the framework more friendly for both users and contributors.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/amedyukhina/deconvtest2/issues).
